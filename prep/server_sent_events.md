# Server-Sent Events (SSE) Use Cases

1. **Real-Time Data Display**: SSE is used in applications that need to fetch constant updates from the server. For example, a web page displaying real-time data such as a live graph.

2. **Notifications**: SSE can be used to notify users about new comments on a website or changes in data.

3. **Live Updates**: SSE is ideal for applications that require live updates, such as a Twitter feed, live sports scores, news updates, or alerts.

4. **E-commerce Projects**: SSE can be used to notify users whenever there is important information they need to know, such as product availability.

5. **Tracking Systems and IoT Projects**: SSE can be used in tracking systems and IoT projects for alarms, notifications, events, rules, and actions.

6. **Live Streaming**: Websites or applications that provide live streaming can use SSE. Examples include live sports matches, YouTube streaming/videos, live blogs, and conferences.

Remember, the choice between SSE and other technologies like WebSockets or HTTP Polling depends on the specific requirements of your application, such as the frequency and regularity of updates, the average number of connected clients, and browser compatibility.
