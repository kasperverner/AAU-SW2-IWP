# STRIDE Model for Security Threats

**STRIDE** is a mnemonic acronym developed by Microsoft for thinking about computer security threats. It stands for:

## S - Spoofing

Involves pretending to be someone else. This could mean impersonating another user, device, or network to gain unauthorized access.

## T - Tampering

Refers to malicious modification of data. An attacker might alter a message being sent over a network to change its meaning.

## R - Repudiation

Involves an attacker denying that they performed an action, making it difficult to prove wrongdoing. A user might deny having performed a transaction.

## I - Information Disclosure

Refers to the exposure of information to individuals who are not supposed to have access to it. A database might be configured incorrectly, allowing unauthorized users to view sensitive information.

## D - Denial of Service

Involves making a system unavailable or unusable. An attacker might flood a network with traffic to prevent legitimate users from accessing it.

## E - Elevation of Privilege

Refers to an attacker gaining elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user. This allows the attacker to perform actions that they are not authorized to do.

Each of these represents a different type of threat that needs to be considered when designing and implementing security measures.
